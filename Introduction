VARIABLES
Variables
In programming, a variable is a container for a value. You can think of variables as little containers for information that live in a computer’s memory. 
Information stored in variables, such as a username, account number, or even personalized greeting can then be found in memory.

Variables also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves.

In short, variables label and store data in memory. There are only a few things you can do with variables:

Create a variable with a descriptive name.
Store or update information stored in a variable.
Reference or “get” information stored in a variable.
It is important to distinguish that variables are not values; they contain values and represent them with a name. 
Observe the diagram with the colored boxes. Each box represents variables; the values are represented by the content, and the name is represented with the label.

In this lesson, we will cover how to use the var, let, and const keywords to create variables.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CREATE A VARIABLE: VAR

There were a lot of changes introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript in 2015. 
One of the biggest changes was two new keywords, let and const, to create, or declare, variables. 
Prior to the ES6, programmers could only use the var keyword to declare variables.

var myName = 'Arya';
console.log(myName);
// Output: Arya
Let’s consider the example above:

var, short for variable, is a JavaScript keyword that creates, or declares, a new variable.
myName is the variable’s name. Capitalizing in this way is a standard convention in JavaScript called camel casing. 
In camel casing you group words into one, the first word is lowercase, then every word that follows will have its first letter uppercased. (e.g. camelCaseEverything).
= is the assignment operator. It assigns the value ('Arya') to the variable (myName).
'Arya' is the value assigned (=) to the variable myName. You can also say that the myName variable is initialized with a value of 'Arya'.
After the variable is declared, the string value 'Arya' is printed to the console by referencing the variable name: console.log(myName).

There are a few general rules for naming variables:
* Variable names cannot start with numbers.
* Variable names are case sensitive, so myName and myname would be different variables.
  It is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.
* Variable names cannot be the same as keywords. For a comprehensive list of keywords check out MDN’s keyword documentation.

Note: In the next exercises, we will learn why ES6’s let and const are the preferred variable keywords by many programmers.
Because there is still a ton of code written prior to ES6, it’s helpful to be familiar with the pre-ES6 var keyword.

If you want to learn more about var and the quirks associated with it, check out the MDN var documentation.

Instructions
1. Declare a variable named favoriteFood using the var keyword and assign to it the string 'pizza'.

2. Declare a variable named numOfSlices using the var keyword and assign to it the number 8.

3. Under the numOfSlices variable, use console.log() to print the value saved to favoriteFood.

On the following line, use console.log() to print the value saved to numOfSlices.


var favoriteFood = 'pizza';

var numOfSlices = 8;
console.log(favoriteFood);
console.log(numOfSlices);

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CREATE A VARIABLE; LET

As mentioned in the previous exercise, the let keyword was introduced in ES6. 
The let keyword signals that the variable can be reassigned a different value. Take a look at the example:

let meal = 'Enchiladas';
console.log(meal); // Output: Enchiladas
meal = 'Burrito';
console.log(meal); // Output: Burrito

Another concept that we should be aware of when using let (and even var) is that we can declare a variable without assigning the variable a value. 
In such a case, the variable will be automatically initialized with a value of undefined:

let price;
console.log(price); // Output: undefined
price = 350;
console.log(price); // Output: 350

Notice in the example above:

If we don’t assign a value to a variable declared using the let keyword, it automatically has a value of undefined.
We can reassign the value of the variable.

Instructions
1. Create a let variable called changeMe and set it equal to the boolean true.

2. On the line after changeMe is declared, set the value of changeMe to be the boolean false.

To check if changeMe was reassigned, log the value saved to changeMe to the console.

et changeMe = true;
changeMe = false;
console.log(changeMe);

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CREATE A VARIABLE: CONST

The const keyword was also introduced in ES6, and is short for the word constant. 
Just like with var and let you can store any value in a const variable. 
The way you declare a const variable and assign a value to it follows the same structure as let and var. Take a look at the following example:

const myName = 'Gilberto';
console.log(myName); // Output: Gilberto

However, a const variable cannot be reassigned because it is constant. If you try to reassign a const variable, you’ll get a TypeError.

Constant variables must be assigned a value when declared. If you try to declare a const variable without a value, you’ll get a SyntaxError.

If you’re trying to decide between which keyword to use, let or const, think about whether you’ll need to reassign the variable later on. 
If you do need to reassign the variable use let, otherwise, use const.

Instructions
1. Create a constant variable named entree and set it to equal to the string 'Enchiladas'.

2. Just to check that you’ve saved the value of 'Enchiladas' to entree, log the value of entree to the console.

3. Great, let’s see what happens if you try to reassign a constant variable.

Paste the following code to the bottom of your program.

entree = 'Tacos'
This code throws the following error when you run your code:

TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
After you clear this checkpoint, if you want to see about another quirk of const in action open the hint!

const entree = 'Enchiladas';
console.log(entree);
entree = 'Tacos'

Hint:
Since our program stops running after encountering an error, we need to delete the line of code from the previous step:

entree = 'Tacos'
Now, let’s test what happens when you try to declare a const variable without a value. Paste in the following code to your program:

const testing;

You should see a different error this time:

SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
If you read through this error, you’ll see that it’s related to syntax, you need to initialize a const variable with a value.

MATHEMATICAL ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS

Let’s consider how we can use variables and math operators to calculate new values and assign them to a variable. 
Check out the example below:

let w = 4;
w = w + 1;
 
console.log(w); // Output: 5
In the example above, we created the variable w with the number 4 assigned to it. 
The following line, w = w + 1, increases the value of w from 4 to 5.

Another way we could have reassigned w after performing some mathematical operation on it is to use built-in mathematical assignment operators. 
We could re-write the code above to be:

let w = 4;
w += 1;
 
console.log(w); // Output: 5
In the second example, we used the += assignment operator to reassign w. 
We’re performing the mathematical operation of the first operator + using the number to the right, then reassigning w to the computed value.

We also have access to other mathematical assignment operators: -=, *=, and /= which work in a similar fashion.

let x = 20;
x -= 5; // Can be written as x = x - 5
console.log(x); // Output: 15
 
let y = 50;
y *= 2; // Can be written as y = y * 2
console.log(y); // Output: 100
 
let z = 8;
z /= 2; // Can be written as z = z / 2
console.log(z); // Output: 4
Let’s practice using these mathematical assignment operators!

Instructions
1. Use the += mathematical assignment operator to increase the value stored in levelUp by 5.

2. Use the -= mathematical assignment operator to decrease the value stored in powerLevel by 100.

3. Use the *= mathematical assignment operator to multiply the value stored in multiplyMe by 11.

4. Use the /= mathematical assignment operator to divide the value stored in quarterMe by 4.

let levelUp = 10;
let powerLevel = 9001;
let multiplyMe = 32;
let quarterMe = 1152;

// Use the mathematical assignments in the space below:

levelUp += 5;
powerLevel -= 100;
multiplyMe *= 11;
quarterMe /= 4;

// These console.log() statements below will help you check the values of the variables.
// You do not need to edit these statements. 
console.log('The value of levelUp:', levelUp); 
console.log('The value of powerLevel:', powerLevel); 
console.log('The value of multiplyMe:', multiplyMe); 
console.log('The value of quarterMe:', quarterMe);

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE INCREMENT AND DECREMENT OPERATOR

Other mathematical assignment operators include the increment operator (++) and decrement operator (--).

The increment operator will increase the value of the variable by 1. 
The decrement operator will decrease the value of the variable by 1. For example:

let a = 10;
a++;
console.log(a); // Output: 11
let b = 20;
b--;
console.log(b); // Output: 19

Just like the previous mathematical assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=), 
the variable’s value is updated and assigned as the new value of that variable.

Instructions
1. Using the increment operator, increase the value of gainedDollar.

2. Using the decrement operator, decrease the value of lostDollar.

let gainedDollar = 3;
let lostDollar = 50;

gainedDollar++;
lostDollar--;

onsole.log(gainedDollar); // Output: 4
console.log(lostDollar); // Output: 49

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STRING CONCATENATION WITH VARIABLES

In previous exercises, we assigned strings to variables. Now, let’s go over how to connect, or concatenate, strings in variables.

The + operator can be used to combine two string values even if those values are being stored in variables:

let myPet = 'armadillo';
console.log('I own a pet ' + myPet + '.'); 
// Output: 'I own a pet armadillo.'
In the example above, we assigned the value 'armadillo' to the myPet variable. 
On the second line, the + operator is used to combine three strings: 'I own a pet', the value saved to myPet, and '.'. 
We log the result of this concatenation to the console as:

I own a pet armadillo.

Instructions
1. Create a variable named favoriteAnimal and set it equal to your favorite animal.

2. Use console.log() to print 'My favorite animal: ANIMAL' to the console. 
Use string concatenation so that ANIMAL is replaced with the value in your favoriteAnimal variable.

let favoriteAnimal = "cat";
console.log("My favorite animal:" + favoriteAnimal); // Output: My favorite animal:cat
